Writing the queries of the [[http://tpc.org/tpch/default5.asp][TPC-H]] benchmark using [[https://github.com/EvgSkv/logica][Logica]].

The =queries= directory has the TPC-H queries. Those ending in =.sql=
extension are the original queries, those ending in =.l= are the
Logica equivalents.

* Reproducing

  1. Download the [[http://tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/current_specifications5.asp][TPC-H tools]] archive and unpack it in the root
     directory of this repository, or else generate or download the
     data some other way.
     - The =tpch-dbgen= directory should be at root directory of this
       repository
     - You must make a copy of the =makefile.suite= file there to a
       file named =makefile=, and tweak it for your platform and
       database choice.
  2. To benchmark Logica with =sqlite=, run =make TPC-H.db= to
     generate the =sqlite= database file.
  3. Run =make all= to generate the SQL queries from the Logica files
     and then benchmark those against the original SQL queries from
     the TPC-H benchmark, generating =build/benchmark.csv= with the
     data.
  4. You can run the =results.awk= script on the output csv to
     generate the ratio statistic we have reported on our [[https://odanoburu.github.io/research-log/logica-tpc.html][blog post]].

* Adding a new query

  1. Add the original SQL file to the =sql= directory.
  2. Add a corresponding Logica file (with =.l= extension) to the
     =logica= directory. It's top-level predicate should be named
     =Query= for we to generate its SQL output automatically.
  3. Add the query to the Makefile under the =QUERIES= variable when
     it is ready to be benchmarked.
  4. Follow the steps for reproducing the benchmark in this README.

* Benchmarking manually
** Logica
  To compile a Logica query to SQL, install Logica (see its [[https://github.com/EvgSkv/logica][repository]]
  for that) and run:

  : logica <query-file> print <query predicate>

  You can also use Logica to run queries directly from the command
  line, or as a Python library.

  By default, the main query predicate in this project should be named
  =Query=, so that we can build all Logica queries automatically
  with=make=.

** Benchmarking code
  To benchmark the Logica-generated queries against the original SQL
  ones, you use the Python module at =src/benchmark.py=. You can try:

  : python src/benchmark.py --check-equivalent --db-address ../TPC-H.db --dir-a ../queries/ --dir-b ../gen-queries/ -d sqlite3 q-02.sql

  To see more options, run =python benchmark.py --help=.
