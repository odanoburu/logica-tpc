Writing the queries of the [[http://tpc.org/tpch/default5.asp][TPC-H]] benchmark using [[https://github.com/EvgSkv/logica][Logica]].

The =queries= directory has the TPC-H queries. Those ending in =.sql=
extension are the original queries, those ending in =.l= are the
Logica equivalents.

To compile a Logica query to SQL, install Logica and run:

: logica <query-file> print <query predicate>
